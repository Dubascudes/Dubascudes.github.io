# PhD Week 76
Wow, 10 whole weeks since my first post. Hopefully, the long run frequency of my posts will be greater than 0.4 posts/month, but I guess we'll see. Regardless of frequency, the purpose of these posts as I stated in the [original post](/posts/2024/11/initial-post/) is to document my life, my thoughts, and the progression of my research. The most significant updates to mention are: 

1. Enrolled at the University of Florida for 3 courses (EEE 5283 with [Dr. Oweiss](https://oweisslab.ece.ufl.edu/), EEL 5934 with [Dr. Islam](https://jahid.ece.ufl.edu/), and EEL 6935 with [Dr. Ruchkin](https://ivan.ece.ufl.edu/))

2. Submitted the paper described in the [previous post](/posts/2024/11/initial-post/) to [ICML](https://icml.cc/)

3. Continuing my work on the [DARPA ANSR project](https://www.darpa.mil/program/assured-neuro-symbolic-learning-and-reasoning)

That's really all I can say about my recent academic progress. I am enjoying all of these classes, and my past experience with ROS2 and Temporal Logics has been a great help this semester. I will provide a more in-depth discussion of the content of these courses in the future.
