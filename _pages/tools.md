I am slave to my sporadic interests and intense curiosity. This has caused me to engage with a number of tools, technologies, libraries, websites, and what have you that I have found exceptionally useful. Here is a list of each one that I can think of, as well as what I use it for. To mantain some level of organization, I break these down into a number of categories that broadly capture an area I find myself working in.
