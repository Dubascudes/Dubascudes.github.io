Hello visitor! My name is Will English, I'm a Computer Engineering PhD student at the University of Florida. I am working under Dr. Rickard Ewetz, specializing in neurosymbolic AI. I received my B.S in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida in 2023. Originally from Pittsburgh, PA (go steelers), I grew up in Saint Augustine, Florida. Outside of academia, some of my interests are backpacking, algorithmic composition (music from code), books (reading and listening), game-making, lucid dreaming, occultism, and a heap of other nonsense that escapes me at the moment. My research interests include Natural Language, Machine Learning, and Unconventional Computing.

This site serves as a CV, portfolio, blog, client portal, and repository of information and tools that I find useful. If you're looking for a tutor, please visit my [teaching](/teaching) page. Otherwise, please explore this site to learn about my professional and recreational activities.
