<p>I have 8 years of experience in programming. You can explore some of my more recent work on my <a href="https://github.com/dubascudes" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and this website.</p>

<p>The courses I traditionally offer include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Introduction to Programming</li>
    <li>Introduction to Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>AP Computer Science Principles</li>
    <li>AP Computer Science A</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't see what you're looking for on that list, send me an email and we'll see what I can do. I can typically support students through any programming or computer science related course, from middle school through college.</p>

<p>If you have a specific course or project you need help with, please provide a few specifics so I know if I can effectively guide you through understanding the subject.</p>

<p>I offer sessions tailored to whatever my client needs. I typically only accept students from 6th grade onwards, but I am happy to accept any passionate student no matter their age or level of experience.</p>

<p style="font-style: normal;">My rates start at \$75/hour for clients who meet 1 hour per week, and \$60/hour for all other clients.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;">If you were recommended by my friends or family, just let me know who recommended you and you will receive a reduced rate of \$50/hour.</p>

<p>If you'd like, please schedule a free introduction with me below. Or, if you prefer, just send me an introductory email with some details about your needs.</p>
