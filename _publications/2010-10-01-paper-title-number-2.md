collection: publications
#permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'The NeSy Program Synthesis approach is evaluated using 600 multi-
hop navigation tasks with 1 to 10 hops. Compared with
neural approaches, the our approach improves the
success rate and path efficiency by an average of 64.3%
and 19.4% across all tasks, respectively.'
